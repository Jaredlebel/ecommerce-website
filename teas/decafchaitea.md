*Masala Chai*, literally "mixed-spice tea" is a flavoured tea beverage made by brewing black tea with a mixture of aromatic Indian spices and herbs. Our decaffeinated version is a great way to the taste without the kick!

Chai Tea comes from the [*Camellia_sinensis*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_sinensis) leaf combined with Indian spices.
