*Earl Grey*  tea is a tea blend with a distinctive smoky flavour and aroma derived from adding the oil extracted from the rind of the bergamot orange. The term "Earl Grey" has traditionally applied only to black teas that contain oil of bergamot as a flavouring.

GreenEarl Greay Tea comes from the [*Camellia_sinensis*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_sinensis) leaf combined with the oil extract of the rind of the bergamot orange.
