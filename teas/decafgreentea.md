*Black Tea* is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, green and white teas. All four types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis. Black tea is generally stronger in flavor than the less oxidized teas.

White Tea comes from the buds of the [*Camellia_sinensis*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_sinensis) leaf.
