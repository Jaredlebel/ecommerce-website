*Oolong Teas* fall between un-oxidised green teas and fully 
oxidised black teas. Produced from larger more mature leaves, 
during processing the leaves are shaken and then left several 
times to “bruise” the edges of the leaves.

Oolong Tea comes from the [*Camellia_sinensis*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_sinensis) leaf.
